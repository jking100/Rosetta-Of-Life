# Rosetta-Of-Life

Rosetta-Of-Life is a collection of implementations of Conway's Game of Life. It is intended as a comparative resource/scratchpad for exploring different programming languages, paradigms, and variations of the Game of Life.

## Overview

This repository is planned to include:

- Implementations in various programming languages
- Variations in rulesets and data structures
- Different programming approaches

Each implementation is organized in its own subdirectory with code and basic information/usage instructions pertaining to it.
